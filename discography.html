        I composed the tune "Child" which Lily recorded on this CD.  Lily and the band reworked some of my harmony to their own tastes.

        I wrote some tunes for this CD, helped engineer and produce, and also released it on my label. Well worth the effort to locate a copy .

        I play piano on this CD of Tim's. I miss playing with Tim. What a brilliant talent ...

        We used to play the song "Gimme some of that" in Banana. Lily wrote her own lyrics and recorded it. Some of my fondest musical memories are of Lily singing my songs. A standout in my mind which I will never forget is a little gig at the Hopetoun we did with Arne Hanna, Hamish Stuart and Alex Hewetson
