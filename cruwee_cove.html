                <p> These are unmastered mixes. Most of these files are uncompressed 48khz 24 bit mixes.
                 They are as "loud" as made sense during mixdown. Via the browser you are listening to a down dither from 24 bit to 16 bit.
                 Downloading and listening to the 24 bit files is highly encouraged by the artist as is making a donation here so I can at least cover the costs of streaming the audio to all.</p>
